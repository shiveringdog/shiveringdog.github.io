<p>Hi everyone!</p>
<p>This is our first post as a team. Hopefully, this blog will become a somewhat consistent devlog. Mainly to keep ourselves accountable, but also so our wonderful fans (currently no one) can follow along and learn from our journey.</p>
<p>We've currently just started working on a new game that we're calling <em>Skychaser</em>. Props to Marcus for the name. It's about a little construction robot that gains sentience and finds meaning to its existence through its journey across a futuristic world. Other than a small amount of story written down and a few images pasted onto a Miro board for inspiration, we haven't got much to show yet. But! We're working very hard to make it a reality.  Since we're university students, things can get a little busy. Hopefully, we'll be able to keep up with our progress and share it with you all.</p>
<p>That's all for now. Until next time!</p>
