Hi everyone!

This is our first post as a team. Hopefully, this blog will become a somewhat consistent devlog. Mainly to keep ourselves accountable, but also so our wonderful fans (currently no one) can follow along and learn from our journey.

We've currently just started working on a new game that we're calling *Skychaser*. Props to Marcus for the name. It's about a little construction robot that gains sentience and finds meaning to its existence through its journey across a futuristic world. Other than a small amount of story written down and a few images pasted onto a Miro board for inspiration, we haven't got much to show yet. But! We're working very hard to make it a reality.  Since we're university students, things can get a little busy. Hopefully, we'll be able to keep up with our progress and share it with you all.

Well, that's all for now. Until next time!
